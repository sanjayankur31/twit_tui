* May 24 2009 Ankur Sinha < ankursinha AT fedoraproject DOT org > - 'bare_release'-2
- Improved the send update and reply interfaces
- Is quicker and than the 'bare_release'-1 : directly channeled the data for parsing instead of a temp file
- Working on errors ( if you give a bad username password for example,you get a blank page as result currently ^_^).Will be fixed in the next 'bare_release'
